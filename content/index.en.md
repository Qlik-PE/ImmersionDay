Accelerate cloud analytics with real-time SAP data using Qlik on AWS

## Overview

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use Qlik Replicate to ingest and deliver data in real-time to your various environments. Follow the step-by-step tutorial to quickly load sample data from a SAP S/4 database into your Amazon Redshift data warehouse. Then watch as data updates happen in real time. Due to cost and timing, this tutorial runs in a single EC2 environment setup with Qlik Replicate and Docker for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Kafka, AWS Aurora, and Single Node Amazon Redshift Cluster.

The Objective of this tutorial is to get introductory hands-on experience using Qlik Data Integration Tools not to become an expert at using Qlik Replicate.

Goals for this Workshop
- Learn how to Configure Qlik Replicate to Work with Source and Target Endpoints.
- Learn how to Design Qlik Replicate Tasks.
- Learn how to Monitor Qlik Replicate Tasks.

Our Tutorials will consist of 1 demo to get students to understand the flow of Qlik Replicate.  Subsequently there is 3 real life scenarios to get hands on experience with Qlik Replicate.

While the tutorial scenario quickly highlights the concept of data ingestion and streaming to PostgresSQL, Kafka, and Amazon Redshift there are additional tuning that can be done to make gain efficiency. Qlik Replicate can also deliver any data from popular relational database systems, mainframes, or SAP applications that you might have in your enterprise.

In addition, at the end of the tutorial you should check out Qlik Compose, our Data Warehousing Automation solution that can automate the process of creating and updating analytics-ready data sets in Amazon Redshift.

A few of the main technical use cases are following.
- Stream Data to another Database
- Stream Data to Kafka Queue
- Stream Data into Cloud Data Warehouse

The target audience for this workshop is Data Engineers, Solution Architects, or anyone with an interest in streaming real-time data into AWS using Qlik Replicate.
